Here is a Python code to read a CSV file:
```python
import csv

# Specify the file path
file_path = "data.csv"

# Open the CSV file
with open(file_path, "r") as csvfile:
    # Create a CSV reader object
    csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    
    # Iterate over the rows in the CSV file
    for row in csvreader:
        # Print each row
        print(row)
```

This code uses the `csv` module to read a CSV file. The `open` function is used to open the file in read mode, and the `csv.reader` class is used to create a CSV reader object that can iterate over the rows in the file. The `for` loop then iterates over each row in the CSV file and prints it.
